# Business Case

---

### **Problem Statement:**

1. Despite substantial efforts by banks to attract and retain customers, customer churn remains a persistent challenge in the banking industry. This issue leads to significant financial losses and adversely impacts customer satisfaction.
2. Identifying and understanding the factors that influence a customer’s decision to leave is essential for effectively addressing churn and improving retention strategies.

### **Proposed Approach:**

1. The primary objective of this project is to analyze customer churn rates to uncover the reasons behind customers’ decisions to leave.
2. Leveraging these insights, the project will focus on developing and training a Machine Learning model capable of identifying the key factors contributing to customer churn.
3. Finally, the project will identify and implement the most reliable predictive model, enabling the assignment of churn probabilities. This will empower customer service teams to proactively target at-risk customers, minimize churn, and optimize retention efforts.
4. You could also explore the following:
    1. How can the insights from churn analysis be translated into actionable strategies for different teams (e.g., marketing, customer service, and product development)?
    2. What proactive measures can be implemented to reduce churn rates before customers consider leaving?
    3. How should the company prioritize its resources to target high-risk customers effectively?
    4. What role does personalization play in customer retention, and how can it be incorporated into product or service offerings?

### About the data:

1. **CustomerId:** It is used to track and differentiate individual customers.
2. **Surname:** It provides information about the family name of each customer.
3. **CreditScore:** It is a numerical value that assesses the creditworthiness of an individual based on their credit history and financial behavior.
4. **Geography:** It provides information about the customers' geographic distribution, allowing for analysis based on regional or national factors.
5. **Gender:** It categorizes customers as either male or female, enabling gender-based analysis if relevant to the churn prediction.
6. **Age:** It represents the customer's age in years and can be used to analyze age-related patterns and behaviors.
7. **Tenure:** It typically represents the number of years or months the customer has been associated with the bank.
8. **Balance:** It reflects the amount of money in the customer's bank account at a specific point in time.
9. **NumOfProducts:** It can include various offerings such as savings accounts, loans, credit cards, etc.
10. **HasCrCard:** It is a binary variable with a value of 1 if the customer possesses a credit card and 0 otherwise.
11. **IsActiveMember:** It is a binary variable indicating whether the customer is an active member (1) or not (0) within the bank.
12. **EstimatedSalary:** It provides an approximation of the customer's income level, which can be relevant for analyzing churn behavior.
13. **Exited:** It indicates whether a customer has churned (1) or not (0) from the bank. It is the variable we aim to predict using the other features.
